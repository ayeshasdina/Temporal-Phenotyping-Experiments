# Temporal-Phenotyping-Experiments
## The parameter of TPO program:
	-i: The name of input weight file. The first column is the name of gene-pairs Connected with a comma. The first row is the time region.
	-d: The name of first input phenotype file
	-f: The name of second input phenotype file
	-g: The name of third input phenotype file
	-m: the first threshold of the first phenotype
	-n: the second threshold of the first phenotype
	-b: the first threshold of the second phenotype
	-v: the second threshold of the second phenotype
	-c: the first threshold of the third phenotype
	-z: the second threshold of the second phenotype
	-w: The threshold of edge weight
	-s: The min size of annotation gene set
	-p: The threshold of purity 
  
  
  ## Explanation:
	The weight file we used in the experiment is generated by NPM method (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/1/67/1742495). We repeatedly (about 100 times) cluster the phenotype values of all the individuals in each time frame using the NPM method with random anchor points and then calculate how often any two individuals are grouped into the same cluster.
	The code is implemented with Python 2.7. The package we used in the program includes numpy, pandas, networkx and so on. If you donâ€™t have these packages, please install first. 
	For the format of input file, please follow the running example strictly.

## Step:
1.	Construct dynamic phenotype network and find cliques.

2.	Generate G(G,E,1) under T=1

3.	Same as step 2, Generate G(G,E,2) under T=2 and G(G,E,3) under T=3.

4.	Fusing G(G,E,1) , G(G,E,2) and G(G,E,3).
5.	Generate the final phenotype ontology after pruning.
